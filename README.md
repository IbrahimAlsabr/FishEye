## Design

FishEye's design was conceived to provide an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing user experience, while highlighting the work of photographers.

### User Interface

The user interface design focuses on simplicity and accessibility. The visual elements enable easy navigation and showcase the photographers' photos and videos effectively.

### Mockups

Mockups were developed to preview the final look of the site before development. You can view the mockups for each main page to understand the structure and flow of the user interface:

-   **Homepage**: Displays a list of all photographers with a quick overview of their profile.
-   **Photographer Profile Page**: Details the photographer's portfolio along with options to contact or like their work.

### Screenshots

Here are some screenshots that illustrate the final result of the site:
